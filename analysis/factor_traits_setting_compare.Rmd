## SNP details for KEGG & all pwy & 3SNPs & pval < 0.01

The 6 pairs belong to 6 different traits. They are not driven by the same SNPs.

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/info_table_annot_pval_kegg_pc_reg_5_d1k_allpval001.rdata")

DT::datatable(final_full, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

## SNP details for REACTOME & all pwy & 3SNPs & pval < 0.01

These 20 pairs belong to 7 different traits. 


```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/info_table_annot_pval_reactome_pc_reg_5_d1k_allpval001.rdata")

DT::datatable(final_full, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

For SCZ, there is 1 SNP shared by 2 factors

For plt, there is 3 SNP shared by 2 factors

For ukb.allasthma, there is 8 SNP shared by 7 factors

```{r echo=FALSE}
shared <- read.csv("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/sharedsnps_reactome_3snps_allpwy.csv",fill = T, header = T)

DT::datatable(shared, options = list(pageLength =5))
```
