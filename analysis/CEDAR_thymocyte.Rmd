## **Introduction**

The traits here are 14 immune traits: T1D, allergy, ukb.allasthma, platelet count (plt), white blood cell count(wbc), myeloid white cell count (myeloid wbc), lymphocyte count(lymph), red blood cell count(wbc), granulocyte count(gran), eosinophil count(eo), neutrophil count (neut), EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC

## **Candidate SNPs**

1: Use PLINK to do the preliminary filter: in 1Mb block,the SNPs have LD R2 > 0.1 will be filtered by their p-values

2: Use my own codes to filter the SNPs in a block by their p-values.

3: We need to compute the LD R2 for the remaining SNPs, for the SNP pairs have R2 > 0.1, filter them again according their p-values. 

## **REACTOME**

In this part, we inferred 5995 PCs from 1199 REACTOME pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set. 

### Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (1667 pairs), we tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 291 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 3.49 fold enrichment). There are 47 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 2.82 fold enrichment).

## **KEGG**

In this part, we inferred 1655 PCs from 331 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set. 

### Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (461 pairs), we tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 84 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 3.64 fold enrichment). There are 17 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 3.68 fold enrichment).
