## Introduction

I tried to find functional SNPs to increase the GWAS power and reduce the testing burden.

## Material and Methods. 

1. Used the pre-trained YFS whole blood weights(provided by FUSION) and  GTEx genotype data to impute the cis component part of gene expression.

2. Used these imputed expression to do the factors ~ cis genetic component part of gene expression + 10 genotype pcs(covariants) association test
