## **Introduction**

In this part, we inferred 116 PLIER-Canonical LVs from GTEx liver expression data. The pipeline is the same with [whole blood data](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.html). The traits are Total Cholesterol(TC),High Density Lipoprotein(HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL),Triglycerides(TG)


## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (18 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There is only 1 pair shows sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling)

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_pcs_reg_5_d500d_pliercanon_liver.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```


To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.
