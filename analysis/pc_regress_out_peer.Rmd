# Introduction

We re-do our analyses with new PCs where the first severl PEER factors computed from global gene expression matrix were regressed out 


# Results

1. We first determined the number of PEER factors that need to be regressed out

2. We determined to regress out 2 PEER factors before doing PCA on KEGG pathways. Then, we did ECT for these factor-trait pairs.
