## Introduction

In this part, the expression data are the same with [CEDAR_origin](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factor_traits_setting_compare_CEDAR.html). The genotype data were imputed using [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html#!) 

In the imputation part, we used 1000G Phase 3 V5 as our reference panel. Mixed population was selected. After imputation, we used rsq > 0.8 to filter the SNPs. We obtained 9,571,582 SNPs. Then we filtered the SNPs using MAF > 0.01 and got 7,741,014 variates. 

Now, we have reasonable SNP numbers when filtering by GWAS p-values.
