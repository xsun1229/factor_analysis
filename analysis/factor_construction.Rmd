  The [PLIER](https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER), [FLASH]( https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr), and [PEER](https://github.com/PMBio/peer/) worked on GTEx gene expression matrix of whole blood(670 samples, 19,696 genes). Genes on chrX were excluded when extracting factors using these softwares.
  
  PCA worked on KEGG 322 pathways. 

# **Factors**

## 1. PLIER

  PLIER(pathway-level information extractor) is a broadly applicable method to accurately infer relevant biological insights, such as variation in cell-type proportion or pathway activity, from global gene expression studies. It approximates the expression pattern of every gene as a linear combination of eigengene-like latent variables (LVs).

  - plier-canonicalPathways
  
  In this part, We just used canonicalPathways which include KEGG and Reactome pathways to extract factors and obtained 128 factors.  [For more details](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factor_plier_canon.html)
  
  - plier-allpathways
  
  We used 'PLIER' package(with default settings) to construct factors related to all pathways provided by the software and got 96 factors. [For more details](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factor_plier_allpathway.html)
  

## 2. FLASH
  
  Using 'FLASH', we obtained 100 factors.

## 3. PEER

  Using 'PEER', I obtained 60 factors.
  
## 4. Principal Component

  I used PCA to infer 1-5 PCs for each pathway.
