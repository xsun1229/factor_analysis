## **Introduction**

The factors in this part are the [PCs](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits.html) after regressing out the GTEx PEER factors. There're 1646 factors in total.


## **Association tests**

We did association tests for PCs and SNPs have p-value < 5E-8 in each trait-GWAS. The association tests were corrected by 10 whole genome PCs + GTEx:Sequencing platform,Sequencing protocol,Sex + AGE

We used 'qvalue' R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP.

 The 'num_significant_pairs' indicates the number of significant pairs under each threshold. If a trait~factor pair has as least 1 significant SNP, we named it as 'significant pair'. The thresholds are 'fdr < 0.1','fdr < 0.2'.


```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/sum_kegg_pcs_sig_pairs_reg.rdata")
knitr::kable(sum, caption = "number of significant trait-LV associations across all traits")
```

## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (1244 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 272 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling). There are 110 pairs at p-value < 0.01). We just focused on these 272 pairs in the following analysis 

**We have a summary table below(together with the IVW part).**

To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.

## **Effectsize analysis -- resampling using IVW estimator**

For the SNPs have FDR < 0.2 in the pairs have more than 2 SNPs at FDR <0.2 (1244 pairs), I computed the IVW estimator. And also did resampling to test the reliability of the results. 

In the resampling part, We resampled the beta.outcome from all SNPs in the trait-factor pair, and fixed the beta.exposure, se.exposure, se.outcome.

We used 'MendelianRandomization' R package to compute the IVW estimator and p-values. 

There are 192 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling). We just focused on these pairs in the following analysis 


```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_fit_ivw_pcs_reg.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =20))
```

After deleting the pairs whose 'num_snp_noMHC' == 0, we got the summary table below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_fit_ivw_noMHC_pcs_reg.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =20))
```


## **Colocalization analysis**

We tested 1250 regions in the colocalization analysis using Coloc package. We ran Coloc with the default parameters and used PP4 to assess evidence of colocalization.

SNP selection: 1. Chose the SNPs in the info table. 2. For each SNP, the region used in colocalization analysis is between [pos-250kb, pos+250kb]. 3. All SNPs in this region are included in alalysis.

There're 68 regions have PP4 > 0.9, 163 regions have PP4 > 0.8.

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/coloc_table_kegg_pcs_reg.rdata")
DT::datatable(table, options = list(pageLength =20))
```

## **SuSiE study**

We do GWAS fine-mapping and obtain GWAS PIPs for all 1250 regions. Then group all SNPs by LV PIPs using 0.25 as threshold. We compare the GWAS PIPs of the two sets.
