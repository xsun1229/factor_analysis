## **Introduction**

In this part, we inferred 6310 PCs from 1262 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set. 

The candidate SNPs are the same with [Liver  PCs](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d_liver.html)

The traits here are HDL, LDL, TC, TG

## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (443 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 110 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 4.97 fold enrichment). There are 20 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 4.5 fold enrichment). 


```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_pcs_reg_5_d500d_reactome_liver.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

After deleting the pairs whose 'num_snp_noMHC' == 0, we got 441 pairs. We used extended MHC area here ([chr6:25726063-33400644](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1489)) There are 109 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 4.97 fold enrichment). There are 20 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 4.5 fold enrichment).  

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_noMHC_pcs_reg_5_extend_d500d_reactome_liver.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.

For the pairs have p-value = 0 in resampling, we set the p-value = 0.001 in the plot below.

## **Detailed results for HDL **

EUR.IBD has 4 factors have p-value close to in resampling. The table below shows the SNP details of these 4 factors. We deleted the pairs that only have SNPs in MHC area.

We also find a lot of SNPs on chr11.

The 4 pathways in this table are: 

[1] "Cytokine Signaling in Immune system"  

[2] "Interleukin-1 family signaling"   

[3] "Intrinsic Pathway of Fibrin Clot Formation"

[4] "PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis"
