# **Introduction**

In this part, we use SuSiE to compute the posterior probability that a SNP to be causal for both LVs and traits.

# **PIP comparison: Trying L=1, L=10 for both LV-Susie-L10, GWAS-Susie**

## Compute PIP with Susie 

1. LV 

We used individual data(GTEx, 670 samples) to compute the PIPs for SNPs. We tried L = 10/ L = 1.

2. GWAS

In this part, we used summary statistics. The LD reference panel was the same with LV part and corrected by the sample size(670). We also tried L = 10/ L = 1.

## Count the SNPs have high/median/low PIP.

We tested 156 regions in total. 

This figure shows the number of regions have at least 1 high/median/low pip SNPs in each setting. For example, in LV susie results (under L = 1 setting), 9 regions have at least 1 SNP that has high pip, 5 regions have at least 1 SNP that has median pip.

This figure shows the number of regions have more than 1 high/median/low pip SNPs in each setting. For example, in LV susie results (under L = 1 setting), no region have >1 SNPs that have high pip, no region have > 1 SNP that has median pip.

</figure>

From the plots above, we can find that most regions usually have only one SNP that has high/median pip.

## Group the SNPs according to their pip(high/median/low) in LV-susie results

In this part, we grouped the SNPs according their pip(high/median/low) from LV susie results. For the SNPs in each group, we computed their pip related to the traits. And made a boxplot for each region. 

Susie can be run in the region containing >1 SNPs. Since most of regions do not contain >1 SNPs for high and median pip group(see the second plot in last part), most boxplots only contain one box.

# **PIP comparison for regions with credible set: LV-Susie-L10, GWAS-Susie-L1**

We have 15 of 156 regions with credible sets from LV fine-mapping(under L=10 setting). In these regions, we do GWAS fine-mapping and obtain GWAS PIPs. Then group all SNPs in these regions by LV PIPs using 0.25 as threshold. We compare the GWAS PIPs of the two sets.

We also make a summary table to show PIPs of all SNPs in regions with credible sets. The table below shows the number of SNPs under different cutoff.

# **PIP comparison for all regions: LV-Susie-L10, GWAS-Susie-L1**

We do GWAS fine-mapping and obtain GWAS PIPs for all regions. Then group all SNPs by LV PIPs using 0.25 as threshold. We compare the GWAS PIPs of the two sets.
