## Introduction

In this part, we use SuSiE to compute the posterior probability that a SNP to be causal for both LVs and traits.

## PIP comparison under different settings for LVs/traits

### Method 

1. LV 

We used individual data(GTEx, 670 samples) to compute the PIPs for SNPs. We tried L = 10/ L = 1.

2. GWAS

In this part, we used summary statistics. The LD reference panel was the same with LV part and corrected by the sample size(670). We also tried L = 10/ L = 1.

### Results

We tested 156 regions in total. 

This figure shows the number of regions have at least 1 high/median/low pip SNPs in each setting. For example, in LV susie results (under L = 1 setting), 9 regions have at least 1 SNP that has high pip, 5 regions have at least 1 SNP that has median pip.

This figure shows the number of regions have more than 1 high/median/low pip SNPs in each setting. For example, in LV susie results (under L = 1 setting), no region have >1 SNPs that have high pip, no region have > 1 SNP that has median pip.

From the plots above, we can find that most regions usually have only one SNP that has high/median pip.

## Grouped results

### Methods

In this part, we grouped the SNPs according their pip(high/median/low) from LV susie results. For the SNPs in each group, we computed their pip related to the traits. And made a boxplot for each region. 

Susie can be run in the region containing >1 SNPs. Since most of regions do not contain >1 SNPs for high and median pip group(see the second plot in last part), most boxplots only contain one box.
