## Introduction

In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with fdr < 0.01 and pval < 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did LD Clumping for these SNPs to eliminate the LD and select a smaller subset of SNPs. Finally, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.

## Material and Methods

1. I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from *Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042* . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn's disease and asthma collected by our lab.

2. Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with fdr < 0.01 and pval < 5e-8 separately. 

3. Did LD Clumping for the SNPs in obtained from step 2. I used default settings of PLINK LD clumping: 
      
     --clump-p1 0.0001            Significance threshold for index SNPs
     
     --clump-p2 0.01              Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs
 
     --clump-r2 0.50              LD threshold for clumping

     --clump-kb 250               Physical distance threshold for clumping

For each trait, I got a subset of SNPs that are not in LD with each other.

4. Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 3. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of whole genome.

5. For Crohn's disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by 'fdr020_num' and selected the top 3/4 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction.

## Results - fdr < 0.01

### Overview

platelet count trait contains  1,956  SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

white blood cell count trait contains 1,057 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

myeloid white cell count trait contains 894 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

lymphocyte count trait contains 1,276  SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

red blood cell count trait contains 1,273 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

granulocyte count trait contains 1,592 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

eosinophil count trait contains  1,480 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

neutrophil count trait contains 1,602  SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

IBD trait contains 595 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

Ulcerative colitist trait contains 317 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

Crohn's disease trait contains 431 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

asthma trait contains 788 SNPs with fdr<0.01. 

### Summary table

I used 'qvalue' R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are 'fdr < 0.1','fdr < 0.2','pval < 5e-8'.

```


### Effect size plots

For Crohn's disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by 'fdr020_num' and selected the top 3 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction. Each dot indicates a variant.
