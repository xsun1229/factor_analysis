# **Testing the effect of cis-eQTLs on factors**

## Methods 

1. Find the genes have non-zero loading for factors. 

2. Find the top cis-eQTLs for each gene from our data. Some genes have more than one top cis-eQTLs(some SNPs have the same lowest p-value). We keep all those cis-eQTL.

3. Filter all top cis-eQTLs again by their GWAS p-values. 

4. We did binomial tests to test if the signs of SNPs' GWAS effects match the sign of their gene effects*sign of the gene loadings. Our hypothesis is: the matching probability is 0.5. 


## Results

We juse focused on the LV-trait pairs that have more than 2 SNPs with FDR < 0.2. We have 68 pairs in total.In 61 of them, some cis-eQTLs have p-values < 5e-7 in GWAS.

We made a table to show the binomial test results.
