# **1. Introduction**

In this part, we're trying to answer the questions below:

- Are expression factors genetically determined? Can we build prediction model of expression factors using genetic variants?

- What are the SNPs and genes controlling expression factors?

# **2. Data**

- Expression data: GTEx whole blood expression data which contains 670 samples and 19,696 genes. Genes on chrX were excluded.

- Genotype data: GTEx genotype data(the variants with maf >0.05 and maf >0.01 were selected, variants on chrX were excluded). 6,568,202 variants have maf >0.05 and 10,403,249 variants have maf >0.01.

# **3. Analyses**

## **3.1 Factor Construction and evaluation**

- We used 4 methods to infer expression factors from the expression matrix. The [PLIER](https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER), [FLASH]( https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr), and [PEER](https://github.com/PMBio/peer/) worked on GTEx gene expression matrix of whole blood(670 samples, 19,696 genes). PCA worked on KEGG 332 pathways. 

- We evaluated the heritability of factors using [GCTA](
https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#GREML) and made histogrames to show the distribution of the heritabilities.

  Using 'FLASH', we obtained 100 factors.

**PC&PEER from KEGG pathways**
  
  I used PCA to infer 1-5 PCs for each pathway. We have 1646 PCs in total.

## **3.2 Prediction models for factors**

I used two groups of variants to train models. The first group contains all variants have maf > 0.01(10,403,249 variants) and maf > 0.05(6,568,202 variants). The second group contains all significant cis-eQTLs provided by GTEx (FDR > 0.05).

The workflow: 

1) I splited the data set into training(80%, 536 samples) and test(20%, 134 samples) set. 
2) In the training data, performed association test between the factors and all SNPs using Plink. I corrected the results for genotype PCs (We used Plink to compute 10 PCs and used them as corvariates in association test).

3) From 3, we selected all SNPs with p < 1e-02 as candidate variants.

4) Trained Lasso/Elastic-net models using SNPs from step4 in the training data and evaluated the performance in the testing data.

5) For factors with relatively low pval_test_l, I did GWAS analysis using all GTEx samples(670 samples). In the association tests, first 10 genotype pcs were included as covariants.

### 3.2.1 Training models with all variants

There are some missing values in our dataset. I used mean imputation (substituing the missing values with mean value of the corresponding variants) to impute the missing value.

### 3.2.3 Trying to make the prediction models better

#### Finding functional SNPs  - LD Score Regression 

The GWAS power of some factors is low. So we tried to find functional SNPs to increase the GWAS power and reduce the testing burden.

We adopted LD score regression to estimate SNP-based heritability and partation the heritability into seperate categories. The software we used here is [ldsc](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc).

The ldsc material and methods of my project can be found [here](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/ldsc.html)

#### Finding functional cis-genes
  
  After preliminary [rough calculations](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/gwas_power.html), we found that there might be overfitting issue. So we tried one/two sample settings to test and eliminate the overfitting issue. 
  
  The rought process are below, it differs slightly in different settings.
  
1. Train weights from expression matrix and genotype matrix. Variants are cis-snps (Â±500kb from the TSS of genes)

2. Impute the cis genetic component part of gene expression (cis-genes):

	 cis-genes = weights * genotype of cis-genes

3. Association test: factors ~ cis-genes + 10 genotype pcs. Record the p-values for each gene.

4. Count the number of significant associations at various p-value threshold for each factor.

  [Two Sample Setting](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/cg-twosample.html)
  
  [One Sample Setting- only cis-eQTLs](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/cg-onesample-ciseqtls.html)
  
#### Dealing with weak IV bias

  Apart from using external weights([Two Sample Setting](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/cg-twosample.html)), I tried other methods to eliminate the weak IV bias issue (divide the cis-eQTLS into different groups according to the p-values).
