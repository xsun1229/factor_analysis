## Introduction

From [PC&PEER from KEGG pathways](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/eval_kegg.html), I found that the 5th PC of Type I diabetes mellitus pathway has the heritability over 0.99. So I performed association test between the fifth PC and all SNPs(from GTEx) using Plink. I corrected the results for genotype PCs. I used Plink to compute 10 PCs and used them as corvariates in association test.

## Results 

Since SNPs in MHC has p < 1e-100, We show the results after removing MHC.

The red line here means -log10(p-value) is 5e-8.

Here's the qqplot of observed p-values vs expected p-values(uniform distribution).
