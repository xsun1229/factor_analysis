## **Introduction**

In this part, we inferred 6105 PCs from 1221 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set. 

The candidate SNPs are the same with [Whole blood PCs](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.html)

## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (3139 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 608 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 3.87 fold enrichment). There are 274 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 8.72 fold enrichment). 


```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_pcs_reg_5_d500d_reactome_wb.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

After deleting the pairs whose 'num_snp_noMHC' == 0, we got 2932 pairs. We used extended MHC area here ([chr6:25726063-33400644](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1489)) There are 494 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 3.36 fold enrichment). There are 197 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 6.7 fold enrichment).  

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_noMHC_pcs_reg_5_extend_d500d_reactome_wb.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.

For the pairs have p-value = 0 in resampling, we set the p-value = 0.001 in the plot below.
