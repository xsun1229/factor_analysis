## **Introduction**

In this part, we inferred 6310 PCs from 1262 REACTOME pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set. 

The traits here are HDL, LDL, TC, TG


## **Candidate SNPs**

1: Use PLINK to do the preliminary filter: in 1Mb block,the SNPs have LD R2 > 0.1 will be filtered by their p-values

2: Use my own codes to filter the SNPs in a block by their p-values.

3: We need to compute the LD R2 for the remaining SNPs, for the SNP pairs have R2 > 0.1, filter them again according their p-values. 


## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (329 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 22 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 1.33 fold enrichment). There are 4 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 1.21 fold enrichment).
