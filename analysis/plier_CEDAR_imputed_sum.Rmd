## Introduction

We used the [PLIER R package](https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER) with the collection of 5546 gene sets as a prior information matrix priorMat available in the package comprising canonical, immune and chemgen pathways from MSigDB (same with the eLife paper)

We used 26 immune and blood cell traits in this part, they are: "mch","mchc","mcv","rdw","ret","baso","plt","pct","pdw","mpv","hct","hgb","ret","mono","T1D", "EUR.IBD","EUR.UC","EUR.CD","ukb.allasthma","eo","wbc","rbc","myeloid_wbc","gran","lymph","neut","allergy"

## LV number 

| cell type      | LV num |

| platelet       | 132    |
| B cell         | 136    |
| T cell(CD4)    | 146    |
| T cell(CD8)    | 134    |
| monocyte CD14  | 88     |
| leukocyte CD15 | 146    |
