## Introduction 

In this part, we inferred 1652 PCs from 332 KEGG pathways. The pipeline is the same with [whole blood data](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.html). The only differences are: 1.we used liver data in this part, 2.the traits are Total Cholesterol(TC),High Density Lipoprotein(HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL),Triglycerides(TG)


## **Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting**

For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR <0.2 (120 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.

To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.

There are 7 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 1.16 fold enrichment). There are 3 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 2.5 fold enrichment). 


```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_pcs_reg_5_d500d_liver.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

After deleting the pairs whose 'num_snp_noMHC' == 0, we got 119 pairs. We used extended MHC area here ([chr6:25726063-33400644](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1489)). There are 7 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values < 0.05 in resampling, 1.16 fold enrichment). There are 3 pairs at p-value < 0.01, 2.5 fold enrichment). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
sum <- read.table("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/simple_sum_noMHC_pcs_reg_5_extend_d500d_liver.txt", header = T)
DT::datatable(sum, options = list(pageLength =5))
```


To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.


**For the pair have p-value == 0 in resampling, we set the p-value = 0.001 to make the plot**

## **Detailed results for HDL **

HDL has 4 factors have p-value < 0.05 in resampling. The table below shows the SNP details. We deleted the pairs that only have SNPs in MHC area.

We found 5 SNPs drive different pathways:

```{r echo=T, eval=FALSE}
chr11_48526997_G_T_b38 : row 5,10
chr11_50136924_G_T_b38 : row 6,12
chr11_54823403_T_C_b38 : row 7,13
chr11_56176998_G_A_b38 : row 8,14
chr11_126348646_A_G_b38 : row 1,15
```

There are 4 pathways in this table: 

[1] "Butanoate metabolism"   

[2] "Cushing syndrome"    not related : [ In Cushing’s syndrome, there is an increase of triglyceride and total cholesterol levels whereas HDL can be at variable levels.](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/314213)     

[3] "Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes"

[4] "Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis"

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/info_table_annot_pval_kegg_pc_reg_5_liver_HDL.rdata")

DT::datatable(final_full, options = list(pageLength =5))
```

For the pairs have relatively more SNPs, we made effectsize plots.

## **Detailed results for TG **

TG has 1 factor has p-value < 0.05 in resampling. The table below shows the SNP details. We deleted the pairs that only have SNPs in MHC area.

The pathway 'Inositol phosphate metabolism' is not related to TG

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("/project2/xinhe/xsun/website/factor_analysis/output/info_table_annot_pval_kegg_pc_reg_5_liver_TG.rdata")
