# **Studying effects of factos on phenotypes with Mendelian Randomization**

We'd like to show that the factors have a causal effect on outcome(traits), but it's difficult to establish.  
So we state a weaker hypothesis first: GWAS variants of a trait often converge to a relatively small number of processes, which can be represented as expression factors.

Then we strengthen hypothesis: if the effects of SNPs on LV is correlated with their effects on trait when there is a causal effect of LV on trait.


## *1. Effect size & Colocalization tests based on FDR cutoff for different factors*

To address issues with respect to computational time and multiple testing, I confined our analysis to those SNPs present in the [Catalog of Published GWAS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). I selected the SNPs with pval < 5e-8/5e-7. Then, I did association tests for the factors with the SNPs.

Each setting below contains effectsize analysis&resampling, colocalization analysis, enrichment analysis.
