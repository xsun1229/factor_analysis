## Introduction

I used 'PLIER' package(with default settings) to construct factors related to KEGG and Reactome pathways here. 



## Results

### Overview

    - The gene expression data from GTEx uses Ensemnl ID. In order to use PLIER R package, we need to convert Ensemnl ID to HGNC Gene Symbol. There are 19,696 genes in GTEx data. After conversion, 16,634 left(not all Ensemnl IDs have a corresponding HGNC Gene Symbol). 5,472 of 16,634 were used in PLIER.
    - I used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 545 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG.
    - I obtained 128 LVs from PLIER, 39 of them have AUC > 0.70(see figure below).



### LVs with AUC>0.70

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
plotU(plierResult, auc.cutoff = 0.7, fdr.cutoff = 0.05, top =3) 
```
