# **Overview**

PLIER analysis was performed using the R package (v.0.99.0; downloaded from https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER). The prior information matrix comprises canonical, immune and chemgen pathways from MSigDB. PLIER was run with 228 iterations. Only the 12999 genes appearing in both gene expression data and the pathway annotation matrix were used as inputs. The other PLIER parameters are all default settings. 98 latent variables (LVs) were inferred.

# **Heritability**

The figure below shows the distribution of h2g and QQ plot of p-values testing if h2g=0. The p-values in QQ plot were computed from the z-scores of h2g follows:

```{r echo=T, eval=FALSE}
zscore <- Heritability/SE 
pval <- 1- pnorm(zscore)
```

The figure below shows the h2g estimate and conf. interval for all LVs.

# **Prediction models**

Prediction models were trained using LASSO and Elastic net for all LVs. Figure below shows the QQ plot of p-values on testing set against uniform distribution where the observed p-values shift to y-axis.

The figure below shows the R2 in testing data for all LVs.

Using p-value on testing set as criterion, top 3 LVs have the best prediction performance were listed below. They are LV60, LV79 and LV3. 

In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). In such LVs, predict_l for all samples are the same.
