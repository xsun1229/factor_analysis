# Introduction

In the earlier analysis, we used local FDR to compute the SNP FDR in association tests. We will correct it here. 


# Results


1. ECT 

[SNP FDR cutoff: 0.2](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/ECT_redo.html)

[SNP FDR cutoff: 0.1](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/ECT_redo_fdr01.html)

2. ACAT

4. Heritability
