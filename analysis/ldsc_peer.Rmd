## Introduction

In this part, I list the ldsc results for plier_CanonicalPathways factors.

I made several plots to show the enrichment and 95% confidence intervals for each lv. Enrichment here is the proportion of prop.h2 devided by prop.snp.


## Results-maf001-unfinished

The covariants of the association test here are lv47,81,120,64,54,58,8,83,89,9,31,102,40,14(heritability = 0.000001, sorting by pval_test_l).

I performed ldsc for lv90,50(lowest pval_test_l from [prediction model](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/train_plier_allpathway.html),, 3.17e-8,1.7e-5,) and lv104(highest heritability, 0.57)

## Results-maf005

The covariants of the association test here are lv59,5,11,34,4,9,58(heritability = 0.000001, sorting by pval_test_l).

I performed ldsc for lv46,38(lowest pval_test_l from [prediction model](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/train_plier_allpathway.html),, 0.006,0.034) and lv6(highest heritability, 0.83)
