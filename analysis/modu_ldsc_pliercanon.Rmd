## Introduction

In this part, I list the ldsc results for plier_CanonicalPathways factors.

I made several plots to show the enrichment and 95% confidence intervals for each lv. Enrichment here is the proportion of prop.h2 devided by prop.snp.

## Results-maf001


I performed ldsc for lv114,113(lowest pval_test_l from [prediction model](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/modu_train_pliercanon.html), 1.87e-3,3.83e-3,) and lv46(highest heritability, 0.463),lv51,5,21(lowest heritability with very high pval_test_l).

### Summary 

For comparison, I made a summary table. The last 3 LVs are negative control factors.
