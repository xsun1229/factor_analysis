This page is about factor analysis. Below are details of analyses. 

# **Factor Construction**

  I used three softwares, [PLIER](https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER), [FLASH]( https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr), and [PEER](https://github.com/PMBio/peer/) to construct factors from GTEx gene expression matrix of whole blood(670 samples, 19,696 genes). Genes on chrX were excluded when extracting factors using these softwares.

## PLIER

  PLIER(pathway-level information extractor) is a broadly applicable method to accurately infer relevant biological insights, such as variation in cell-type proportion or pathway activity, from global gene expression studies. It approximates the expression pattern of every gene as a linear combination of eigengene-like latent variables (LVs).

  - plier-canonicalPathways
  
  In this part, I just used canonicalPathways which include KEGG and Reactome pathways to extract factors and obtained 128 factors.  [For more details](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factor_plier_canon.html)
  
  - plier-allpathways
  
  I used 'PLIER' package(with default settings) to construct factors related to all pathways provided by the software and got 96 factors. [For more details](https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factor_plier_allpathway.html)
  
## FLASH
  
  Using 'FLASH', I obtained 100 factors from our GTEx expression matrix.

## PEER

  Using 'PEER', I obtained 60 factors from the GTEx expression matrix.
  
# **Factor evaluation**

I first evaluated the heritability of factors using [GCTA](
https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#GREML) and made histogrames to show the distribution of the heritabilities.

When computing heritability, I used GTEx genotype data(the variants with maf >0.05 and maf >0.01 were selected, variants on chrX are excluded). 6,568,202 variants have maf >0.05 and 10,403,249 variants have maf >0.01.

# **Prediction models for factors**

In this part, I tried to train prediction models for factors ~ genotype using Lasso and Elastic-net. I used whole blood genotype data from GTEx including 670 samples. In genptype data, there are 10,403,249 variants in total (variants in chrX have been excluded). The workflow are listed below.

1. There are some missing values in our dataset. I used mean imputation (substitue the missing values with mean value of the corresponding variants) to impute the missing value.

2. I splited the data set into training(80%, 536 samples) and test(20%, 134 samples) set. 

3. In the training data, performed association test between the factors and all SNPs using Plink. I corrected the results for genotype PCs (We used Plink to compute 10 PCs and used them as corvariates in association test).

4. From 3, we selected all SNPs with p < 1e-02 as candidate variants.

5. Trained Lasso/Elastic-net models using SNPs from step4 in the training data and evaluated the performance in the testing data.

6. For factors with relatively low pval_test_l, I did GWAS analysis using all GTEx . In the association tests, first 10 genotype pcs were included as covariants.
