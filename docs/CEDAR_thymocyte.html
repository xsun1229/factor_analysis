Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/514fb26a44b7da4e6ead3c66fe19c54f9532f083" target="_blank">514fb26</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/CEDAR_thymocyte.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/CEDAR_thymocyte.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The traits here are 14 immune traits: T1D, allergy, ukb.allasthma, platelet count (plt), white blood cell count(wbc), myeloid white cell count (myeloid wbc), lymphocyte count(lymph), red blood cell count(wbc), granulocyte count(gran), eosinophil count(eo), neutrophil count (neut), EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC</p>

<div id="candidate-snps" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Candidate SNPs</strong></h2>
<p>1: Use PLINK to do the preliminary filter: in 1Mb block,the SNPs have LD R2 &gt; 0.1 will be filtered by their p-values</p>
<p>2: Use my own codes to filter the SNPs in a block by their p-values.</p>
<p>3: We need to compute the LD R2 for the remaining SNPs, for the SNP pairs have R2 &gt; 0.1, filter them again according their p-values.</p>
</div>
<div id="reactome" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>REACTOME</strong></h2>
<p>In this part, we inferred 5995 PCs from 1199 REACTOME pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set.</p>
<div id="effectsize-analysis-effect-size-fitting" class="section level3">
<h3>Effectsize analysis – effect size fitting</h3>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (1667 pairs), we tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 291 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 3.49 fold enrichment). There are 47 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 2.82 fold enrichment).</p>

<p>In this part, we inferred 1655 PCs from 331 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set.</p>

<h3>Effectsize analysis – effect size fitting</h3>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (461 pairs), we tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 84 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 3.64 fold enrichment). There are 17 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 3.68 fold enrichment).</p>
