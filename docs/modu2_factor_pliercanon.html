Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/f6a45e68f78204dec6377bbb9df6c58e91cc5e67" target="_blank">f6a45e6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I used ‘PLIER’ package(with default settings) to construct factors related to Canonical Pathways from module 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="factor-construction" class="section level2">
<h2>Factor Construction</h2>
<pre><code>- The gene expression data from GTEx uses Ensemnl ID. In order to use PLIER R package, we need to convert Ensemnl ID to HGNC Gene Symbol. There are 19,696 genes in GTEx data. After conversion, 16,634 left(not all Ensemnl IDs have a corresponding HGNC Gene Symbol). 311 of 16,634 were used in this part.
- I used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 545 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG.
- I obtained 114 LVs from PLIER, 18 of them have AUC &gt; 0.70.</code></pre>

<h2>Prediction model</h2>
<p>In this part, I adopted lasso/elastic_net regression to train prediction models. The dependent variables here were LVs extracted from and the independent variables were genotype of certain variants. (LVs ~ variant genotype)</p>
<p>There are 774 genes in this module. PLIER used 311 of them to infer factors. I got 114 factors for this module.</p>

<h3>Heritability vs R-squared</h3>
<p>This figure shows the prediction performance (R2 of Lasso/Elastic_net regression on training set in red) in comparison to LV heritability estimates (black; standard errors in gray). Performance was assessed using tenfold cross-validation in the GTEx whole-blood cohort (on training set, n = 536) with the elastic net and lasso models.</p>

<h3>Summary of Heritability</h3>
<p>The table below shows the heritability of LVs and performance of the training models. The table has been sorted by Heritability from small to large.</p>
<p>Some notations to explain: <strong>rsq_min</strong> is the r-squared when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>ncoef_nzero_min</strong> is the number of non-zero coefficients when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>rsq_test</strong> is the r-squared in testing set (obtained from lm(lv.obs ~ lv.pred)) ,<strong>pval_test</strong> is the pvalue of F-statistics in testing set. When the suffix is ’_1se’, the notations mean lambda=lambda.1se. Suffix ’_l’ means lasso regression and ’_e’ means elastic_net</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  ###Lasso regression. &#39;k&#39; represents the kth LV.
    fit_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha =1, foldid = foldid)   ##&#39;foldid = foldid&#39; can fix the data partition in cross validation, making the codes reproducible
    fit_r_train_l[k]  &lt;- fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$dev.ratio[which(fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda == fit_lasso$lambda.min)]  ###r2 when lambda = lambda.min

    rsq_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). It means the variant in regression is linearly with the intercept. After checking the predict_l, we found the predict_l for all samples are the same.</p>

<h3>LVs with relatively low pval_test_l</h3>
<p>By sorting the pval_test_l in the table above, I foung that only LV15 have relatively low pvalues on testing set. We made scatter plots of predicted LVs vs. observed LVs for them. Besides, we did GWAS analysis.</p>
<p>The red line in manhattan plot means p-value is 5e-8.</p>
