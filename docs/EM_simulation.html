Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/6289a9a931d24dd3c70544420cba0b71029afebb" target="_blank">6289a9a</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/EM_simulation.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/EM_simulation.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, we did some simulations for RBC-LV82 pair to check the EM algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the simulation part, we need to determine the value of <strong><em>alpha_j</em></strong>, <strong><em>beta_hat_j</em></strong>, <strong><em>s_j</em></strong>, and <strong><em>pi_j</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The values of <strong><em>alpha_j</em></strong> are the effect size from the LV ~ SNPs association tests. <strong><em>pi_j</em></strong> can be computed from the FDR analysis using LV ~ SNPs association test results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>s_j</em></strong> are the standard error of GWAS data. For simplification, we use the median of <strong><em>s_j</em></strong>. Sampling <strong><em>beta_hat_j</em></strong> is based on Equation 17 in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/project/5fc6d070dbe8f5b9fe43a54b">Overleaf file</a>. We first sample <strong><em>Z_j</em></strong> from Bernoulli(<strong><em>pi_j </em></strong>), and sample <strong><em>beta_hat_j</em></strong> accordingly. If <strong><em>Z_j</em></strong> = 1, sample from normal distribution (use the true value of <strong><em>gamma</em></strong> here); if <strong><em>Z_j</em></strong> = 0, sample from TN distribution, using rtruncnorm function.</p></li>
<li><p>We made scatter plot of effect sizes(alpha vs simulated beta), the fitted slope (gamma) are shown in each plot. The dots are colored according to p_j (posterior estimate)</p></li>
<li><p>I did resampling in the simulated data, obtained p-values, and compared with LRT results.</p></li>
