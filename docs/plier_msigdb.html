Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/640cfe6414cdc786917734a3611b682ae0710fab" target="_blank">640cfe6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>PLIER analysis was performed using the R package (v.0.99.0; downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER" class="uri">https://github.com/wgmao/PLIER</a>). The prior information matrix comprises canonical, immune and chemgen pathways from MSigDB. PLIER was run with 228 iterations. Only the 12999 genes appearing in both gene expression data and the pathway annotation matrix were used as inputs. The other PLIER parameters are all default settings. 98 latent variables (LVs) were inferred.</p>

<p>Prediction models were trained using LASSO and Elastic net for all LVs. Figure below shows the QQ plot of p-values on testing set against uniform distribution where the observed p-values shift to y-axis.</p>

<p>Using p-value on testing set as criterion, top 3 LVs have the best prediction performance were listed below. They are LV60, LV79 and LV3.</p>
<p>In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). In such LVs, predict_l for all samples are the same.</p>

http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
