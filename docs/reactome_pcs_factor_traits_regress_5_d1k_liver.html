Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/7153859a5dc4b38f6e8be10c794e1d6a0c6232dd" target="_blank">7153859</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.
</p>

<div id="versions" class="tab-pane fade">

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/reactome_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d1k_liver.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/reactome_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d1k_liver.html</code>) files.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In this part, we inferred 6310 PCs from 1262 REACTOME pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set.</p>
<p>The traits here are HDL, LDL, TC, TG</p>

<p>1: Use PLINK to do the preliminary filter: in 1Mb block,the SNPs have LD R2 &gt; 0.1 will be filtered by their p-values</p>
<p>2: Use my own codes to filter the SNPs in a block by their p-values.</p>
<p>3: We need to compute the LD R2 for the remaining SNPs, for the SNP pairs have R2 &gt; 0.1, filter them again according their p-values.</p>

<h2><strong>Effectsize analysis – effect size fitting</strong></h2>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (329 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 22 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 1.33 fold enrichment). There are 4 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 1.21 fold enrichment).</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
