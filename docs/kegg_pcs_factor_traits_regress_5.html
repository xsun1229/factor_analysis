Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/efa811459eaeded923131639352a3c4efbbbe131" target="_blank">efa8114</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The factors in this part are the <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits.html">PCs</a> after regressing out 5 GTEx PEER factors. There’re 1646 factors in total.</p>
</div>
<div id="association-tests" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Association tests</strong></h2>
<p>We did association tests for PCs and SNPs have p-value &lt; 5E-8 in each trait-GWAS. The association tests were corrected by 10 whole genome PCs + GTEx:Sequencing platform,Sequencing protocol,Sex + AGE</p>
<p>We used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP.</p>
</div>
<div id="effectsize-analysis-effect-size-fitting" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Effectsize analysis – effect size fitting</strong></h2>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (1064 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 218 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling). There are 81 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01).</p>

<p>To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>
