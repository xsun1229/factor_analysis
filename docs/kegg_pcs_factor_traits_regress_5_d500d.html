Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/e150e3f87921d5d7c304b6e0a288c0b25d984e52" target="_blank">e150e3f</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.html</code>) files.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In this part, we inferred 1646 PCs from 332 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype. We regressed out top 5 PEER factors from the GTEx data set.</p>
</div>
<div id="candidate-snps" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Candidate SNPs</strong></h2>
<p>The candidate SNPs in this part are trait-related SNPs. We first filtered the SNPs using pval &lt; 5e-8 as cut off. Then we did LD Clumping for those SNPs.The PLINK LD Clumping patameters are:</p>
<p>– clump-p1 0.0001 Significance threshold for index SNPs</p>
<p>– clump-p2 0.01 Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs</p>
<p>– clump-r2 0.1 LD threshold for clumping</p>
<p>– clump-kb 500 Physical distance threshold for clumping</p>
<p>After LD Clumping, we removed SNPs that are too close (within 500kb).</p>
</div>
<div id="effectsize-analysis----effect-size-fitting" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Effectsize analysis -- effect size fitting</strong></h2>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (920 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 215 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 4.67 fold enrichment). There are 75 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 8.3 fold enrichment).</p>

<p>After deleting the pairs whose 'num_snp_noMHC' == 0, we got 735 pairs. We used extended MHC area here (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1489">chr6:25726063-33400644</a>) There are 135 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 3.67 fold enrichment). There are 33 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 4.49 fold enrichment).</p>

<p>To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
