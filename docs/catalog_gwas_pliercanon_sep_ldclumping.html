Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/d9ada894374c9a8ede79d17b7b52dfe1ac34b3cd" target="_blank">d9ada89</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did LD Clumping for these SNPs to eliminate the LD and select a smaller subset of SNPs. Finally, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from <em>Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. <a href="doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042" class="uri">doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042</a></em> . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn’s disease and asthma collected by our lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Did LD Clumping for the SNPs in obtained from step 2. I used default settings of PLINK LD clumping:</p>
<p>–clump-p1 0.0001 Significance threshold for index SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-p2 0.01 Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-r2 0.2 LD threshold for clumping</p>
<p>–clump-kb 250 Physical distance threshold for clumping</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each trait, I got a subset of SNPs that are not in LD with each other.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 3. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of whole genome.</p></li>
<li><p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 3/4 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction.</p></li>

<h2>Results - fdr &lt; 0.01</h2>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>platelet count trait contains 1001 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>white blood cell count trait contains 552 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>myeloid white cell count trait contains 440 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>lymphocyte count trait contains 646 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>red blood cell count trait contains 669 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>granulocyte count trait contains 810 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>eosinophil count trait contains 736 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>neutrophil count trait contains 807 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>IBD trait contains 309 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitist trait contains 177 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease trait contains 231 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>asthma trait contains 453 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 2 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction. Each dot indicates a variant.</p>
<p>I add thress lines to make the plots clear. They are x=0, y=0 and y=x.</p>

<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 2 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction.Each dot indicates a variant.</p>
<p>I add thress lines to make the plots clear. They are x=0, y=0 and y=x.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
