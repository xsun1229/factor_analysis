Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/b41d4c63a7a90e4918d7cdb956aee2ff3ba664b8" target="_blank">b41d4c6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did LD Clumping for these SNPs to eliminate the LD and select a smaller subset of SNPs. Finally, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from <em>Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. <a href="doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042" class="uri">doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042</a></em> . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn’s disease and asthma collected by our lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Did LD Clumping for the SNPs in obtained from step 2. I used default settings of PLINK LD clumping:</p>
<p>–clump-p1 0.0001 Significance threshold for index SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-p2 0.01 Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-r2 0.2 LD threshold for clumping</p>
<p>–clump-kb 250 Physical distance threshold for clumping</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each trait, I got a subset of SNPs that are not in LD with each other.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 3. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of whole genome.</p></li>
<li><p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 3/4 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction.</p></li>

<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>After filtering by ‘fdr&lt;0.01’ and LD Clumping, for each trait, I got :</p>
<p>platelet count trait contains 1001 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>white blood cell count trait contains 552 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>myeloid white cell count trait contains 440 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>lymphocyte count trait contains 646 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>red blood cell count trait contains 669 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>granulocyte count trait contains 810 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>eosinophil count trait contains 736 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>neutrophil count trait contains 807 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>IBD trait contains 309 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitist trait contains 177 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease trait contains 231 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>asthma trait contains 453 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 2 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction. Each dot indicates a variant.</p>
<p>I add thress lines to make the plots clear. They are x=0, y=0 and y=x.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>After filtering by ‘fdr&lt;0.01’ and LD Clumping, for each trait, I got :</p>
<p>platelet count trait contains 1,073 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>white blood cell count trait contains 591 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>myeloid white cell count trait contains 490 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>lymphocyte count trait contains 699 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>red blood cell count trait contains 731 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>granulocyte count trait contains 464 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>eosinophil count trait contains 786 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>neutrophil count trait contains 476 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>IBD trait contains 178 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitist trait contains 103 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease trait contains 142 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>asthma trait contains 283 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>

<div id="summary-table-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For Crohn’s disease, IBD, and Ulcerative colitist, I sorted the LVs by ‘fdr020_num’ and selected the top 2 LVs. For each LV, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) in meta-GWAS) to show if the variants have the same effect direction.Each dot indicates a variant.</p>
<p>I add thress lines to make the plots clear. They are x=0, y=0 and y=x.</p>
