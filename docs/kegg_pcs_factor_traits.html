Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/6339f6e4952d236b5eb5b2126f12d86b06a45059" target="_blank">6339f6e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  output/coloc_table_kegg_peer.rdata

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/kegg_peer_factor_traits.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In this part, we inferred 1646 PCs from 332 KEGG pathways and studied the effects of these PCs on phenotype.</p>
<p>The data we used in this part are the same with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d1000.html">earlier analyses</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="association-tests" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Association tests</strong></h2>
<p>We did association tests for PCs and SNPs have p-value &lt; 5E-8 in each trait-GWAS. The association tests were corrected by 10 whole genome PCs + GTEx:Sequencing platform,Sequencing protocol,Sex + AGE</p>
<p>We used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP.</p>
<p>The ‘num_significant_pairs’ indicates the number of significant pairs under each threshold. If a trait~factor pair has as least 1 significant SNP, we named it as ‘significant pair’. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’.</p>

<h2><strong>Effectsize analysis</strong></h2>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (830 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 125 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling). We just focused on these pairs in the following analysis</p>

<p>To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>

<h2><strong>Colocalization analysis</strong></h2>
<p>We tested 698 regions in the colocalization analysis using Coloc package. We ran Coloc with the default parameters and used PP4 to assess evidence of colocalization.</p>
<p>SNP selection: 1. Chose the SNPs in the info table. 2. For each SNP, the region used in colocalization analysis is between [pos-250kb, pos+250kb]. 3. All SNPs in this region are included in alalysis.</p>
<p>There’re 22 regions have PP4 &gt; 0.9, 61 regions have PP4 &gt; 0.8.</p>
