Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/02d036b924f7e3ab7e617c676264cc5036e0f225" target="_blank">02d036b</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  delete.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d500.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d500.html</code>) files.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did LD Clumping for these SNPs to eliminate the LD and select a smaller subset of SNPs. Finally, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from <em>Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. <a href="doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042" class="uri">doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042</a></em> . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn’s disease and asthma collected by our lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Did LD Clumping for the SNPs in obtained from step 2. I used default settings of PLINK LD clumping:</p>
<p>–clump-p1 0.0001 Significance threshold for index SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-p2 0.01 Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-r2 0.1 LD threshold for clumping</p>
<p>–clump-kb 500 Physical distance threshold for clumping</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each trait, I got a subset of SNPs that are not in LD with each other.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 3. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of whole genome.</p></li>
<li><p>For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html">TwoSampleMR</a> R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots.</p></li>
<li><p>For the traits and LVs in 5, I made an info table to show more details of the SNPs.</p></li>
<li><p>For several LVs we are interested in, I did gene set enrichment analysis to test if the LVs are correlated with some KEGG/REACTOME pathways. I used two kind gene sets to do GSEA: 1. genes that used to compute LVs; 2. Sorting the genes in 1 by their loadings, take the top 25% as the gene set. For both gene sets, the gene scores used as input of GSEA are the gene loadings.</p></li>

<h2>Results - fdr &lt; 0.01</h2>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>After filtering by ‘fdr&lt;0.01’ and LD Clumping, for each trait, I got :</p>
<p>platelet count trait contains 661 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>white blood cell count trait contains 262 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>myeloid white cell count trait contains 308 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>lymphocyte count trait contains 419 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>red blood cell count trait contains 443 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>granulocyte count trait contains 570 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>eosinophil count trait contains 474 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>neutrophil count trait contains 568 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>IBD trait contains 210 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitist trait contains 131 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease trait contains 159 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
<p>asthma trait contains 321 SNPs with fdr&lt;0.01.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. For each trait,The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included.</p>
<p>The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>
<p>‘snp_ld’ here means the snps that in LD with the snp in each line.’ld_r2’ means the LD r-squared which is corresponding to the ‘snp_ld’ column. ‘cis-eqtl’ column indicates whether the snp is a cis-eqtl according to GTEx data. ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ and ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ is the genes that the snp influence when it act as cis-eqtl. ‘func’ and ‘func_gene’ are obtained from ANNOVAR, which indicating the snp function within the genes.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html">TwoSampleMR</a> R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots.</p>

<p>After filtering by ‘fdr&lt;0.01’ and LD Clumping, for each trait, I got :</p>
<p>platelet count trait contains 712 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>white blood cell count trait contains 392 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>myeloid white cell count trait contains 337 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>lymphocyte count trait contains 456 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>red blood cell count trait contains 487 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>granulocyte count trait contains 326 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>eosinophil count trait contains 512 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>neutrophil count trait contains 333 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>IBD trait contains 120 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitist trait contains 75 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease trait contains 100 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>asthma trait contains 191 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>

<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Gene set enrichment analysis</h3>
<p>For some promising trait-factor pairs (i.e. RBC-LV82, Asthma-LV36, LV40, LV68, WBC-LV119, Lymphocyte-LV23, LV78), I did gene set enrichment with WebGestalt. I used two kind gene sets to do GSEA: 1. genes that used to compute LVs; 2. Sorting the genes in 1 by their loadings, take the top 25% as the gene set. For both gene sets, the gene scores used as input of GSEA are the gene loadings.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. For each trait,The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included.</p>
<p>The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>
<p>‘snp_ld’ here means the snps that in LD with the snp in each line.’ld_r2’ means the LD r-squared which is corresponding to the ‘snp_ld’ column. ‘cis-eqtl’ column indicates whether the snp is a cis-eqtl according to GTEx data. ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ and ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ is the genes that the snp influence when it act as cis-eqtl. ‘func’ and ‘func_gene’ are obtained from ANNOVAR, which indicating the snp function within the genes.</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html">TwoSampleMR</a> R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
