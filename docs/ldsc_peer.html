Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/4db7d8f47a2beb2ea5e3016e11cdaddcf5cc49e7" target="_blank">4db7d8f</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/ldsc_peer.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/ldsc_peer.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I list the ldsc results for PEER factors.</p>
<p>I made several plots to show the enrichment and 95% confidence intervals for each factor. Enrichment here is the proportion of prop.h2 devided by prop.snp.</p>
</div>
<div id="results-maf001" class="section level2">
<h2>Results-maf001</h2>
<p>I performed ldsc for lv46,52(lowest pval_test_l from <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/train_peer.html">prediction model</a>, 5.27e-5,0.0089) and lv4(highest heritability, 0.47),lv5,56(lowest heritability with very high pval_test_l).</p>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For comparison, I made a summary table. The last 2 LVs are negative control factors.</p>
