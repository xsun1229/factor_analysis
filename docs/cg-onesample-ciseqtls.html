Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/9b2b31462b8c241e6f15bf212d6ffcd291d45e52" target="_blank">9b2b314</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/cg-onesample-ciseqtls.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/cg-onesample-ciseqtls.html</code>) files.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I split the GTEx data into two halves, and use one half to train the expression model, and the other half to assess association with factors.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Weights training</li>
</ol>
<p>Split the GTEx samples(670) into two equal part (part1-training part, part2). Employ FUSION to train weights on part1, models: LASSO, Elastic-net, BLUP</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cis-gene imputation</li>
</ol>
<p>Use weights in step1 to impute the cis genetic component part of gene expression. For both part1 and part2, we imputed cis-genes and named these cis-genes as cis-gene-part1 and cis-gene-part2.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Association test:</li>
</ol>
<p>LVs ~ cis-gene-part1</p>

<li><p>14,976 of 19,696 genes have cis-snps.</p></li>
<li><p>I got 180 weights from lasso model, 179 from elastic-net model, 179 weights from blup models.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The tables below show the number of significant associations at various p-value threshold for each LV. The first column is the pearson corralation index. The suffix ’_s’ means impute gene expression using the same part samples and the suffix ’_d’ means impute gene expression using different part samples.</p>
<p>I also made a histogram to show the distribution of the numbers.</p>
