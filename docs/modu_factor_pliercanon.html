Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/0153beecfda6be6b91d2150e3520be96aacb5602" target="_blank">0153bee</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I used ‘PLIER’ package(with default settings) to construct factors related to Canonical Pathways from module 1.</p>
<p>When employing CanonicalPathway to run PLIER, only the first 3 modules can be used in the software and get the factors. Others cannot be used correctly in PLIER because the datasets are small. The table below shows the number of genes and factors in module.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<pre><code>- The gene expression data from GTEx uses Ensemnl ID. In order to use PLIER R package, we need to convert Ensemnl ID to HGNC Gene Symbol. There are 19,696 genes in GTEx data. After conversion, 16,634 left(not all Ensemnl IDs have a corresponding HGNC Gene Symbol). 760 of 16,634 were used in this part.
- I used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 545 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG.
- I obtained 120 LVs from PLIER, 30 of them have AUC &gt; 0.70(see figure below).</code></pre>

<div id="heritability-of-factors" class="section level2">
<h2>Heritability of factors</h2>
<p>I evaluated the heritability of factors using <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#GREML">GCTA</a> and made histogrames to show the distribution of the heritabilities.</p>
<p>When computing heritability, I used GTEx genotype data(the variants with maf &gt;0.01 were selected, variants on chrX are excluded). 10,403,249 variants have maf &gt;0.01.</p>

TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
