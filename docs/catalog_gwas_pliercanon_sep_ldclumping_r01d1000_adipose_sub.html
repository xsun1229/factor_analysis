Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/c663a38ae1d7a86b8ae2098645a8dd4a2eb63dc9" target="_blank">c663a38</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d1000_adipose_sub.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d1000_adipose_sub.html</code>) files.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The analysis in this part is the same with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d1000.html">PLIER-Canonical</a>. But in this part, I used Adipose Subcutaneous expression data. It contains 581 samples. I used PLIER with Canonical Pathway and inferred 142 LVs first. And used these 142 LVs to do the following analysis.</p>

<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<p>This part is the same with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep_ldclumping_r01d1000.html">PLIER-Canonical</a>.</p>

<div id="snps-after-filter" class="section level2">
<h2>Snps after filter</h2>
<p>After filtering by ‘pval &lt; 5e-8’ and LD Clumping, for each trait, I got :</p>
<p>BMI trait contains 102 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>T1D trait contains 65 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8</p>
<p>T2D trait contains 14 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8. T2D_2 contains 4 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>TG trait contains 152 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8</p>
<p>TC trait contains 254 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8</p>
<p>HDL trait contains 225 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>LDL trait contains 203 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>
<p>WHR trait contains 37 SNPs with pval&lt;5e-8.</p>

<div id="summary-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’. The ‘num_significant_pairs’ indicates the number of significant pairs under each threshold. If a trait~factor pair has as least 1 significant SNP, we named it as ‘significant pair’.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. For each trait,The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included.</p>
<p>The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files.</p>
<p>‘snp_ld’ here means the snps that in LD with the snp in each line.’ld_r2’ means the LD r-squared which is corresponding to the ‘snp_ld’ column. ‘cis-eqtl’ column indicates whether the snp is a cis-eqtl according to GTEx data. ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ and ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ is the genes that the snp influence when it act as cis-eqtl. ‘func’ and ‘func_gene’ are obtained from ANNOVAR, which indicating the snp function within the genes.</p>

<h3>Effectsize summary</h3>
<p>To summarize the results above, I made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. Below are plots for three FDR cutoffs, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>

<h3>Colocalization – 1000kb</h3>
<p>The colocalization analysis was performed using the approximate Bayes factor test implemented in the Coloc package. Coloc computes five posterior probabilities (PP0, PP1, PP2, PP3 and PP4), each corresponding to a hypothesis: H0, no association with either trait; H1, association with trait 1 but not with trait 2; H2, association with trait 2 but not with trait 1; H3, association with trait 1 and trait 2, two independent SNPs; H4, association with trait 1 and trait 2, one shared SNP. We ran Coloc with the default parameters and used PP4 to assess evidence of colocalization. We visualized the colocalization of factor - QTLs and GWAS associations using the <a href="https://github.com/boxiangliu/locuscomparer">LocusCompareR package</a>.</p>
<p>SNP selection: 1. Chose the SNPs in the info table. 2. For each SNP, the region used in colocalization analysis is between [pos-1000kb, pos+1000kb]. 3. All SNPs in this region are included in alalysis.</p>

<!-- ### Effect size plots & Resampling -->
<!-- For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by [TwoSampleMR](https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html) R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR<0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots. -->
<!-- I also relaxed the fdr threshold of the SNPs that used to make effect size plots(from 0.2 to 0.3/0.5) -->
<!-- For all pairs , I did resampling. I resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the pvalues and r-squared. The resampling was repeated 1000 times. -->
<!-- I made a histogram to show the rsquared distribution from resampling. The red line in the plots are the rsquared in the origin analysis. The r_mean values in the plots are the mean values of rsquared in point fitting. The 'p-value from resampling' is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling). -->

<!-- ### Colocalization -- 500kb -->
<!-- The colocalization analysis was performed using the approximate Bayes factor test implemented in the Coloc package. Coloc computes five posterior probabilities (PP0, PP1, PP2, PP3 and PP4), each corresponding to a hypothesis: H0, no association with either trait; H1, association with trait 1 but not with trait 2; H2, association with trait 2 but not with trait 1; H3, association with trait 1 and trait 2, two independent SNPs; H4, association with trait 1 and trait 2, one shared SNP. We ran Coloc with the default parameters and used PP4 to assess evidence of colocalization. We visualized the colocalization of factor - QTLs and GWAS associations using the [LocusCompareR package](https://github.com/boxiangliu/locuscomparer). -->
<!-- Chromosome selection: I first sorted the SNPs by their pvalues from factor association tests, then I selected the first two SNPs and chose their chromosome to do the colocalization test adn visualization.  -->
