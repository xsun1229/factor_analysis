Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/42c445b0d63ef679edb2b28c0ae1f16074e7bfb6" target="_blank">42c445b</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/catalog_gwas_pliercanon_sep.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from <em>Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. <a href="doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042" class="uri">doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042</a></em> . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn’s disease and asthma collected by our lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with fdr &lt; 0.01 and pval &lt; 5e-8 separately.</p></li>
<li><p>Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 2. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of these SNPs.</p></li>

<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Summary table – compute genotype pcs from current dataset</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Summary table – compute genotype pcs from whole genome</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>
