The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/bfdd3a3333fae8af48b95ee9d2ce3665e65f7abc" target="_blank">bfdd3a3</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/acat_fdr.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were

<h1>Calibrate ACAT p-values by trait.</h1>
<p>We can get a conclusion that results are driven mostly by some
traits, instead of pathways. So we will correct ACAT p-values using
random SNPs from the same trait.</p>
<p>That is, for each trait (trait X), use the random ACAT p-values
related to trait X (all factor-trait X pairs) as null distribution, then
correct the real ACAT p-values. All calibration will be done within each
trait. In this way, we will not need to make a QQ-plot showing the
random ACAT and real ACAT p-values to demonstrate the signal from real
ACAT. Showing the QQ-plot of calibrated real ACAT p-values will be
enough.</p>
<p>We calibrated p-values according to:</p>
<p>p_corr[t] &lt;- sum(p_real[t] &gt; p_random)/length(p_random)</p>
<p>For those p_corr == 0, we set p_corr[p_corr == 0] &lt;-
0.5/length(p_random)</p>
<p><img src="figure/acat_fdr.Rmd/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="1728" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are many pairs have same calibrated p-values, especially for
the pairs whose real ACAT p-values are small. The reason is that the
number of (p_random &lt; p_real[t]) is small for these pairs. So they
are all set to same values.</p>
