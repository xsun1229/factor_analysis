Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  analysis/ECT_redo_acat_corrected.Rmd

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/ECT_redo_acat_filtered.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/magma_fdr.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/redo_correct_lfdr.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<p>top genes:</p>
<p>RELA: <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q04206/entry">RELA
shows a weak DNA-binding site which could contribute directly to DNA
binding in the NF-kappa-B complex. Beside its activity as a direct
transcriptional activator, it is also able to modulate promoters
accessibility to transcription factors and thereby indirectly regulate
gene expression</a></p>
<p>GAB2 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9846">Gab2 plays a
pivotal role in the EGF-induced ERK activation pathway and that it can
complement the function of Gab1 in the EGF signalling pathway; Gab1 and
Gab2 are critical signalling threshold proteins for ERK activation by
EGF</a></p>
<p>MAPK3 <a
href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MAPK3">MAP
kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs),
act in a signaling cascade that regulates various cellular processes
such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell cycle progression in
response to a variety of extracellular signals.</a></p>
<p>PPP2R2A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPP2R2A">The product
of this gene belongs to the phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B family.
Protein phosphatase 2 is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases, and
it is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and
division</a></p>
<p>PPP2R5B has similar functions</p>
<p>TP53 <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/">The TP53
gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p53
(or p53). This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it
regulates cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing
(proliferating) too fast or in an uncontrolled way.</a></p>

<p>BAX BAK1 <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488910003368">Bax
and Bak are two nuclear-encoded proteins present in higher eukaryotes
that are able to pierce the mitochondrial outer membrane to mediate cell
death by apoptosis. Thus, organelles recruited by nucleated cells to
supply energy can be recruited by Bax and Bak to kill cells.</a></p>
<p>BAD <a
href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BAD">The
protein encoded by this gene is a member of the BCL-2 family. BCL-2
family members are known to be regulators of programmed cell death. This
protein positively regulates cell apoptosis by forming heterodimers with
BCL-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large) and BCL-2, and reversing their
death repressor activity. Proapoptotic activity of this protein is
regulated through its phosphorylation. Protein kinases AKT and MAP
kinase, as well as protein phosphatase calcineurin were found to be
involved in the regulation of this protein. Alternative splicing of this
gene results in two transcript variants which encode the same
isoform</a></p>
<p>RB1 <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/rb1/">The RB1 gene
provides instructions for making a protein called pRB. This protein acts
as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell growth and
keeps cells from dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.</a></p>
<p>BCL2L1 <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-2589-7">BCL-xL/BCL2L1
is a critical anti-apoptotic protein that promotes the survival of
differentiating pancreatic cells from human pluripotent stem
cells</a></p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
