Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/e4bf324e1c0756e1152921d7fd8d6a6ae7fa78f9" target="_blank">e4bf324</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h3>Summary table (26 traits)</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’. The ‘num_significant_pairs’ indicates the number of significant pairs under each threshold. If a trait~factor pair has as least 1 significant SNP, we named it as ‘significant pair’.</p>

<h3>Info table (26 traits)</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. For each trait,The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included.</p>
<p>The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC,T2D, asthma, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>
<p>‘snp_ld’ here means the snps that in LD with the snp in each line.‘ld_r2’ means the LD r-squared which is corresponding to the ‘snp_ld’ column. ‘cis-eqtl’ column indicates whether the snp is a cis-eqtl according to GTEx data. ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ and ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ is the genes that the snp influence when it act as cis-eqtl. ‘func’ and ‘func_gene’ are obtained from ANNOVAR, which indicating the snp function within the genes.</p>

<h3>Effectsize summary (26 traits)</h3>
<p>To summarize the results above, I made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. Below are plots for three FDR cutoffs, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>

<h3>Colocalization – 1000kb (26 traits)</h3>
<p>The colocalization analysis was performed using the approximate Bayes factor test implemented in the Coloc package. Coloc computes five posterior probabilities (PP0, PP1, PP2, PP3 and PP4), each corresponding to a hypothesis: H0, no association with either trait; H1, association with trait 1 but not with trait 2; H2, association with trait 2 but not with trait 1; H3, association with trait 1 and trait 2, two independent SNPs; H4, association with trait 1 and trait 2, one shared SNP. We ran Coloc with the default parameters and used PP4 to assess evidence of colocalization. We visualized the colocalization of factor - QTLs and GWAS associations using the <a href="https://github.com/boxiangliu/locuscomparer">LocusCompareR package</a>.</p>
<p>SNP selection: 1. Chose the SNPs in the info table. 2. For each SNP, the region used in colocalization analysis is between [pos-1000kb, pos+1000kb]. 3. All SNPs in this region are included in alalysis.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
