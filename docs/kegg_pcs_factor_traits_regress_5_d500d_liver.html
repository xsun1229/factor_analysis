Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/aa992861d8613be26df85dfd69782d8796ce2978" target="_blank">aa99286</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, we inferred 1652 PCs from 332 KEGG pathways. The pipeline is the same with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/kegg_pcs_factor_traits_regress_5_d500d.html">whole blood data</a>. The only differences are: 1.we used liver data in this part, 2.the traits are Total Cholesterol(TC),High Density Lipoprotein(HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL),Triglycerides(TG)</p>

<div id="effectsize-analysis-effect-size-fitting" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Effectsize analysis – effect size fitting</strong></h2>
<p>For the pairs have more than 2 SNPs with FDR &lt;0.2 (120 pairs), we also tested the effectsize correlation(effect size in GWAS and effect size in factos-association). We fitted the effectsize using: effectsize in GWAS ~ 0 +effectsize in factor-association. We recorded the p-values and r-squareds in the fitting.</p>
<p>To make our results more reliable, we did resampling. We resampled the SNPs without replacement and fitted the points with intercept = 0 again and recorded the r-squareds to compute the p-values in resampling. The ‘p-value from resampling’ is computed by: (number of more extreme values)/(times of resampling).The resampling was repeated 1000 times.</p>
<p>There are 8 pairs show sign consistency (have p-values &lt; 0.05 in resampling, 1.63 fold enrichment). There are 1 pairs at p-value &lt; 0.01, 1 fold enrichment).</p>

<p>To summarize the results, We made a scatter plot of all trait-LV pairs. The x-axis shows the R2 in fitting, and the y-axis show the -log10-p values from resampling. To make the plot more informative, Each point represent a trait-LV pair. Different colors show the number of SNPs passing the FDR threshold for each pair.</p>
<p><strong>For the pair have p-value == 0 in resampling, we set the p-value = 0.001 to make the plot</strong></p>
