Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/a615ad1783e02ed49da717b94364e69761b6696e" target="_blank">a615ad1</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  output/effectsize_lv3_bmi_pval5e8_d1k_fdr03.jpeg

    Untracked:  output/fdrhist_lv3_bmi_pval5e8_d1k.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, I considered the traits separately. I selected the SNPs with pval &lt; 5e-8 for each traits. Then, I did LD Clumping for these SNPs to eliminate the LD and select a smaller subset of SNPs. Finally, I did GWAS analysis for the plier_canonical factors with the SNPs.</p>

<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I used the GWAS results of 12 immune traits: platelet count, white blood cell count, myeloid white cell count, lymphocyte counts, red blood cell count, granulocyte count, eosinophil count, neutrophil count. These data are from <em>Astle WJ, Elding H, Jiang T, et al. The Allelic Landscape of Human Blood Cell Trait Variation and Links to Common Complex Disease. Cell. 2016;167(5):1415-1429.e19. <a href="doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042" class="uri">doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042</a></em> . I also used IBD,Ulcerative colitist,Crohn’s disease, asthma, BMI,and T2D collected by our lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Computed the fdr of each SNP according to their p-values from GWAS data. Chose those SNPs with pval &lt; 5e-8.</p></li>
<li><p>Did LD Clumping for the SNPs in obtained from step 2. I used default settings of PLINK LD clumping:</p>
<p>–clump-p1 0.0001 Significance threshold for index SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-p2 0.01 Secondary significance threshold for clumped SNPs</p>
<p>–clump-r2 0.1 LD threshold for clumping</p>
<p>–clump-kb 1000 Physical distance threshold for clumping</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For each trait, I got a subset of SNPs that are not in LD with each other.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Did GWAS analysis for plier_canonical factors and SNPs from 3. The association tests were corrected by 10 genotype PCs of whole genome.</p></li>
<li><p>For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html">TwoSampleMR</a> R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots.</p></li>
<li><p>For the traits and LVs in 5, I made an info table to show more details of the SNPs.</p></li>
<li><p>For several LVs we are interested in, I did gene set enrichment analysis to test if the LVs are correlated with some KEGG/REACTOME pathways. I used two kind gene sets to do GSEA: 1. genes that used to compute LVs; 2. Sorting the genes in 1 by their loadings, take the top 25% as the gene set. For both gene sets, the gene scores used as input of GSEA are the gene loadings.</p></li>

<div id="summary-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary table</h3>
<p>I used ‘qvalue’ R package to compute the fdr from p-values for each SNP and made a table to show the number of SNPs that pass the threshold. The thresholds are ‘fdr &lt; 0.1’,‘fdr &lt; 0.2’,‘pval &lt; 5e-8’.</p>

<h3>Info table</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a table to show the info of snps with fdr&gt;0.2 in the factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. For each trait,The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included.</p>
<p>The suffix ’_assoc’ here means that results are from factor ~ SNP + genotype pcs association test. The suffix ’_gwas’ here means results are from original GWAS results files. For EUR.CD, EUR.IBD, EUR.UC, the effectsize_gwas here means ‘ln(OR)’, for others, it means ‘beta’.</p>
<p>‘snp_ld’ here means the snps that in LD with the snp in each line.’ld_r2’ means the LD r-squared which is corresponding to the ‘snp_ld’ column. ‘cis-eqtl’ column indicates whether the snp is a cis-eqtl according to GTEx data. ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ and ‘cis_gene_hgnc’ is the genes that the snp influence when it act as cis-eqtl. ‘func’ and ‘func_gene’ are obtained from ANNOVAR, which indicating the snp function within the genes.</p>

<h3>Enrichment analysis</h3>
<p>For some promising trait-factor pairs (i.e. BMI-LV3, LV27, RBC-LV82, AsthmaLV68, WBC-LV119, Lymphocyte-LV23, LV78), I did enrichment analysis with WebGestalt. The analysis are under different settings:</p>

<h3>Effect size plots</h3>
<p>For each trait, I made a plot of association with LV(indicating by beta in GWAS) vs association with trait(indicating by ln(odds ratio) or beta in GWAS) to show if the variants have the correlated effect direction. The effect sizes of Catalog GWAS and factor association tests are harmonized by <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/articles/introduction.html">TwoSampleMR</a> R package to make the effect alleles in these two analysis identical. The LVs have more than one significant SNPs with FDR&lt;0.2 are included in the plotting.Besides, for each plots, I fitted the points with intercept = 0. The pvalues and r-squared are shown on the plots.</p>

<p>For some promising trait-factor pairs (i.e. BMI-LV3, LV27,LV76, RBC-LV82, Asthma-LV68, WBC-LV119, Lymphocyte-LV23, LV78), I relaxed the fdr threshold of the SNPs that used to make effect size plots(from 0.2 to 0.3/0.5)</p>
