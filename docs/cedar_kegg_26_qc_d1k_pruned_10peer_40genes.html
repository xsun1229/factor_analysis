Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/factor_analysis/tree/10a922edd6c423b4f32d20c4e72f8a7a733bbf74" target="_blank">10a922e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory
    Ignored:    output/.Rhistory

Untracked files:
    Untracked:  output/mbe_tcell_cedar_qc_kegg_pruned_10peer_40genes.rdata

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    output/mbe_tcell_cedar_qc_kegg_pruned_10peer_40genes.rdata.rdata

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>We selected the results for pathways have &gt;40 genes from <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/cedar_kegg_26_qc_d1k_pruned_10peer.html">here</a></p>
<p>We added colocalization analysis for the pairs show sign consistency (at p-value &lt; 0.002), the loci are +-250kb/500kb from the reported SNPs.</p>
<p>We just listed the pairs show sign consistency in the tables below.</p>
<p>‘pval_in_resampling_2’ in the tables means the p-value from <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/factor_analysis/factors_traits.html#32_sign_consistency_checking">adaptive resampling</a>. ‘pval_in_resampling’ in the tables were computed from 1000 times resampling.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
